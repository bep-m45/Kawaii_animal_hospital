# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)
Doctor.create(email: "ddd@ddd", password: "dddddd")
# categories = Category.create([{ name: "お知らせ"}, { name: "診療" }, { name: "トリミング" }, { name: "未分類" }])
